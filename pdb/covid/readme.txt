This archive contains a model of SARS-CoV2 created as a part of a submission to VIS 2020.

Format of data:
- plain text format
- one protein model instance per line

Format of the line: "<model-name> x y z rot.y rot.z -rot.s -rot.x <sequence-id>" where:
- <model-name> is the name of PDB file within this archive
- x,y,z are coordinates of the protein model
- "rot" is a rotation represented by a quaternion of the protein model
- <sequence-id> represents the order in which the element was populated by a rule
